# Cryptography Project
Made by: Franklin Muhuni, Nicholas Hughes, and Shriji Shah 
 
For our project we were tasked with creating our own unique cryptographic encryption system that did not use any other libraries or any form of randomization. Additionally we could not copy existing encryption systems. With that in mind we decide to make the NFS (**N**icholas, **F**ranklin, **S**hriji) Encryption.

## Plaintext
Our plaintext was the "Bee Movie (2007)" movie script. There are no spaces in the plaintext except for a very spefici section, _**"Ontario Tech University"**_ to make it easier for decryption purposes in our project.  
## Alphabet 
Our apahabet was a 81 characters consisting non-repeating numbers, special characters and letters. 
```
Alphabet = “UGiSoxrcT>He94w<sVmF8$|7=f#*1zWqj6,NgX-kKdM+.ZD5?tuBCYO@E;&A23Pn:!JQv%lapRI~bhyL0”
 ```
## Key
the key we used was just something that was 9 charcters long and had legal characters that our grid could support. 
```
Key = #MaThGoDs
```


## Encryption System - NFS Encryption 
For our system we plaintext was converted through the following functions:

- Is a 9 x 9 grid/matrix.

- Convert the results to binary. 
- Then XOR the results of binary.
